\section{Token Economics (\$AI)}
\subsection{Utility}
\$AI is the protocol token for staking, market fees, job settlement, and governance. \emph{Compute credits} \(\Theta\) are minted by locking \$AI at current HMM rate and burned on settlement.

\subsection{Emissions and Rewards}
Per block, distribute \(R\) \$AI: validators \(\beta R\), workers \(\gamma R\) pro-rata verified work, curators \(\delta R\) by experience quality shares, treasury \((1-\beta-\gamma-\delta)R\). A PoAI bonus applies: for job \(j\) with value \(V_j\) and verified cost \(K_j\), reward \(\rho V_j\) (\(\rho\le 0.1\)) split among parties. Slashing burns a fraction \(\sigma\) of bonds on fraud.

\subsection{Fees and Burns}
HMM fees split to LPs and treasury; a fixed fraction \(\zeta\) of market fees is burned to offset emissions. Experience submissions pay a deposit \(D\); refunds scale with measured utility.
