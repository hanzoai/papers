\section{Proof of AI (PoAI) and Job Settlement}
\subsection{Task Lifecycle}
(1) Client escrows \$AI and mints a credit \(\Delta\Theta\). (2) Router clears against HMM to allocate \(\Delta\Psi\). (3) Workers execute and emit \emph{attestations}: TEE report + Merkle commitments of I/O + optional succinct proof. (4) Verifiers sample-check; (5) Settlement releases \$AI to workers, rebates unused capacity to pool, distributes fees.

\subsection{Attestation Primitives}
\emph{TEE path:} enclave measurements + signed runtime traces. \emph{ZK path:} SNARK-friendly kernels for small circuits; \emph{Batch audit:} randomized canary prompts or seed-replay for LLM inference. Misbehavior triggers slashing and denial windows.

\subsection{Closed-Form Expert Weights from PoAI}
For each expert \(m\), let \(q_m \in [0,1]\) denote the Bayesian reliability (precision) estimated from historical attestations. Under a PoE framework, the optimal weight follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:poai-weights}
\eta_m \propto \frac{q_m}{1-q_m},
\end{equation}
yielding precision-weighted combination. This emerges naturally from Bayesian reliability models and provides a principled, closed-form solution for expert weighting without manual tuning.
